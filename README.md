# elk-k8s-demo
a sample set of K8s artifacts to deploy an ELK stack 

# Task
Kubernetes cluster and applications logs have to be stored in centralized location

ElasticSearch was selected as such centralized location, Kibana can be used for data visualisation

# Solution
Filebeat was selected for logs shipping because of itâ€™s lightweight, speed and integration with ELK

Filebeat will be used for shipping logs from Kubernetes cluster and from local log files in docker containers (if any)
